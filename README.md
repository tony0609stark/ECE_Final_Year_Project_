# ECE_Final_Year_Project_
This is the Final Year Project I made when I was completing my B.Tech in Electronics &amp; Communication.

This Project is titled as  "Automated Seed Sowing Robot".

This project is about eradicating the workload of farmers by helping them with the technology. This Robot or can say this project help is various manners such as seed sowing, spraying water/pesticides/insecticides, ploughing etc. 

I thought to share this as it could help someone who wants a final year project for their course.
